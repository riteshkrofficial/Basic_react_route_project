In this project mainly we have understood routing concept that is navigation from one page to another.

Also some methods say one method that is  with code example mentioned here =>
                          CODE
import React from 'react'
import Header from './components/Header/Header'
import Footer from './components/Footer/Footer'
import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom'

const Layout = () => {
  return (
    <>
    <Header/>
    <Outlet/>      
    <Footer/>
    </>
  )
}

export default Layout

In above code the  "<Outlet/>"    method that is used in most of the project as it defines the methods  above and below will
be available in each page as per the code header and footer.
